Saving my 3D Profile: Old Summit School, Mill Valley, California. 

Building was erected in the summer of 1890 and then re-modeled in 1895 by Edward R. Swain. Old Summit School dates back farther than any other school in Mill Valley. What was initially a one-story, one-room shanty, grew into an sprawling iconic historical building. By 1904 the attendance was the third largest in the country. 
Unfortunately, in the year 1940, the building burnt down. By then, however, the precedent it set for the public school system in Mill Valley was tremendous. At the time there were four school buildings with a standing attendance of around 700 student in the area. Old Summit School disappeared the same year the Mill Valley held a celebration of fifty years as a community and it would not be surpising if many that attended were old alumni.
